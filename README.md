# Spotify / Last.fm / OBS - Now Playing

AutoHotkey script for

1. Retrieving currently playing song in Spotify and output to file
2. Use Last.fm API to get album art and ouput to file

This was originally written to get album art to display while streaming in OBS. This was a workaround of sorts because as far as I could find, there was not an easy way to retrieve Spotify album art without first retrieving the URI.

## Usage
1. Rename settings_example.ini to settings.ini
2. Fill in Last.fm username and api key
3. Optionally, enable or disable desktop notification in settings.ini

## TODO

- Create GUI
- Add more settings
